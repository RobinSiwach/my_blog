# Docker

Docker carves up a running linux system into small containers, each of its own sealed little world, with its own programs and its own everything. All isolated from anything else. 

* These containers are designed to be portable, so they can be shipped from one place to another, and Docker does the work of getting these containers to and from your systems. 
* Docker also builds these containers for you, and its a social platform to help you find and share containers with others who may have build similar work that you can build on top of. 
* ***Docker is not a virtual machine.*** There's only single operating system running. That operating system is just carved up into isolated spaces.
