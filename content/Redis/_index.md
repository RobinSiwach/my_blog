# REDIS

* Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store which supports doing strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes.
* It has high availability, replication and automatic partitioning so it is a good option for data persistence
* Redis is written in ANSI C.
